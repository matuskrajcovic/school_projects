				Honey, I'm still free<br/>
				Take a chance on me<br/>
				If you need me, let me know<br/>
				Gonna be around<br/>
				If you've got no place to go<br/>
				When you're feeling down<br/>
				If you're all alone<br/>
				When the pretty birds have flown<br/>
				Honey, I'm still free<br/>
				Take a chance on me<br/>
				Gonna do my very best<br/>
				And it ain't no lie<br/>
				If you put me to the test<br/>
				If you let me try<br/>
				Take a chance on me<br/>
				That's all I ask of you, honey<br/>
				Take a chance on me<br/>
				We can go dancing (oh)<br/>
				We can go walking (yeah)<br/>
				As long as we're together (long as we're together)<br/>
				Listen to some music (oh)<br/>
				Maybe just talking (yeah)<br/>
				Get to know you better (get to know you better)<br/>
				'Cause you know I've got<br/>
				So much that I wanna do<br/>
				When I dream I'm alone with you, it's magic<br/>
				You want me to leave it there<br/>
				Afraid of a love affair, but I think you know<br/>
				That I can't let go<br/>
				If you change your mind<br/>
				I'm the first in line<br/>
				Honey, I'm still free<br/>
				Take a chance on me<br/>

				Gonna do my very best<br/>
				And it ain't no lie<br/>
				If you put me to the test<br/>
				If you let me try<br/>
				Take a chance on me<br/>
				Come on, give me a break, will you?<br/>
				Take a chance on me<br/>
				Oh, you can take your time, baby (oh)<br/>
				I'm in no hurry (yeah)<br/>
				Know I'm gonna get you (know I'm gonna get you)<br/>
				You don't wanna hurt me (oh)<br/>
				Baby, don't worry (yeah)<br/>
				I ain't gonna let you (I ain't gonna let you)<br/>
				Let me tell you now<br/>
				My love is strong enough<br/>
				To last when things are rough, it's magic<br/>
				You say that I waste my time<br/>
				But I can't get you off my mind, no, I can't let go<br/>
				'Cause I love you so<br/>
				If you change your mind<br/>
				I'm the first in line<br/>
				Honey, I'm still free<br/>

				<![CDATA[ 
				I want to drive away<br/>
				In the night, headlights call my name<br/>
				I, I'll never be, be what you see inside<br/>
				You say I'm not alone, but I am petrified<br/>
				You say that you are close, is close the closest star?<br/>
				You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far<br/>
				And I'll fall<br/>
				And I'll break<br/>
				And I'll fake<br/>
				All I wanna<br/>
				And I'll fall down<br/>
				And I'll break down<br/>
				And I'll fake you out<br/>
				All I wanna<br/>
				I'm so afraid<br/>
				Of what you have to say<br/>
				'Cause I am quiet now<br/>
				And silence gives you space<br/>
				I'll never be, be what you see inside<br/>
				You say I'm not alone, but I am petrified<br/>
				You say that you are close, is close the closest star?<br/>
				You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far<br/>
				And I'll fall<br/>
				And I'll break<br/>
				And I'll fake<br/>
				All I wanna<br/>
				And I'll fall down<br/>
				And I'll break down<br/>
				And I'll fake you out<br/>
				All I wanna<br/>
				It's the same game today as it always is<br/>
				I don't give these places fake my name explaining this<br/>
				And the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines<br/>
				That remind me of all the times<br/>
				I have committed<br/>
				Dirty dirty crimes that are perfectly form-fitted<br/>
				To what I've done and what I'm doing<br/>
				I'm brewing and losing and spewing infusing<br/>
				And believe me that's what all the kids are doing<br/>
				What kids are doing are killing themselves<br/>
				They feel they have no control of their prisoner's cell<br/>
				And if you're one of them then you're one of me<br/>
				And you would do almost anything just to feel free<br/>
				Am I right, of course I am<br/>
				Convince me otherwise would take all night<br/>
				Before you walk away, there's one more thing I want to say<br/>
				Our brains are sick but that's okay<br/>
				I'll fake you out<br/>
				I'll fake you out<br/>
				And I'll break down<br/>
				I'll fake you out<br/>
				And I'll fall<br/>
				And I'll break<br/>
				And I'll fake<br/>
				All I wanna<br/>
				I'll fake you out<br/>
				I'll fake you out<br/>
				I'll fake you out<br/>
				And I'll break down<br/>
				I'll fake you out<br/>
				I'll fake you out<br/>
				I'll fake you out<br/>
				And I'll break down<br/>
				All I wanna<br/>
				Yeah, and I'll fall down<br/>
				And I'll break down<br/>
				And I'll fake you out<br/>
				All I wanna<br/>
				Yeah, and I'll fall down<br/>
				And I'll break down<br/>
				And I'll fake you out<br/>
				All I wanna<br/>
				I'm so afraid<br/>
				Of what you have to say<br/>
